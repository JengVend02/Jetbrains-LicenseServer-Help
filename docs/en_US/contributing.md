Welcome to contribute to the JetBrains License Server Help project! This guide will help you understand how to participate in the development and maintenance of the project.

## 1. Contribution Overview

We welcome various forms of contributions, including but not limited to:

- Bug fixes
- New features
- Documentation improvements
- Code optimizations
- Issue reporting and suggestions

## 2. Ways to Contribute

### 2.1 Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature suggestion, you can report it through the following steps:

1. First, search in the [Issue](https://github.com/JengVend02/Jetbrains-LicenseServer-Help/issues) page to see if someone has already reported the same issue
2. If no relevant issue is found, create a new Issue with the following information:
   - Issue description: Clearly and detailedly describe the problem you encountered
   - Reproduction steps: Provide detailed operating steps to reproduce the issue
   - Expected result: The normal behavior you expect
   - Actual result: The error or abnormal behavior that actually occurred
   - Environment information: Operating system, JDK version, project version, etc.
   - Screenshots or logs: If possible, provide relevant screenshots or error logs

### 2.2 Submitting Code

If you want to directly contribute code, you can follow the following process:

1. Fork this project to your GitHub account
2. Clone your Fork repository to your local machine
3. Create a new branch (following naming conventions)
4. Develop on the new branch
5. Commit code and push to your Fork repository
6. Create a Pull Request to the main repository

## 3. Development Environment Setup

### 3.1 Environment Requirements

- JDK 17+
- Maven 3.6+
- Git
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA is recommended (other IDEs can also be used)

### 3.2 Project Initialization

1. Clone the project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JengVend02/Jetbrains-LicenseServer-Help.git
cd Jetbrains-LicenseServer-Help
```

2. Install dependencies using Maven:

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

3. Import the project into your IDE:
   - IntelliJ IDEA: Select File -> Open, then select the pom.xml file in the project root directory
   - Eclipse: Select File -> Import, then select Maven -> Existing Maven Projects

4. Start the project:
   - Directly run the `JetbrainsLicenseServerHelpApplication.java` class
   - Or use Maven command: `mvn spring-boot:run`

## 4. Coding Standards

To maintain code consistency and readability, we follow the following coding standards:

### 4.1 Java Coding Standards

- Follow Java naming conventions:
  - Class names: Use PascalCase, such as `LicenseServerController`
  - Method names: Use camelCase, such as `generateLicenseCode`
  - Variable names: Use camelCase, such as `licenseName`
  - Constant names: All uppercase, words separated by underscores, such as `SERVER_PORT`

- Code indentation: Use 4 spaces
- Line width: No more than 120 characters
- Comments: Use Javadoc comments for classes and methods, and add necessary single-line comments for key code segments

### 4.2 Project Structure Standards

- Controller classes are placed under the `controller` package
- Service classes are placed under the `service` package
- Data access classes are placed under the `repository` package
- Entity classes are placed under the `entity` package
- Utility classes are placed under the `utils` package
- Configuration classes are placed under the `config` package

### 4.3 Git Commit Standards

- Commit messages should be concise and clear, using English
- Commit message format: `type(scope): subject`
  - type: Commit type (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore)
  - scope: Optional, affected module or file
  - subject: Brief description of the commit content

- Examples:
  - `feat(license): add license code generation feature`
  - `fix(controller): fix null pointer exception in DataController`
  - `docs(en_US): update installation guide`

## 5. Submission Process

1. Before starting development, ensure that your local main branch is up-to-date:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

2. Create a new branch, following the naming convention:
   - Bug fixes: `fix/issue-number-description`
   - New features: `feat/feature-name`
   - Documentation updates: `docs/language/topic`

```bash
git checkout -b feat/new-license-feature
```

3. Develop on the new branch, ensuring compliance with coding standards

4. Run tests to ensure code quality:

```bash
mvn test
```

5. Commit code with standardized commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(license): add new license feature"
```

6. Push to your Fork repository:

```bash
git push origin feat/new-license-feature
```

## 6. Pull Request Process

1. Log in to GitHub and enter your Fork repository
2. Click the "New Pull Request" button
3. Select your branch and the main repository's `main` branch for comparison
4. Fill in the Pull Request description, including:
   - The problem solved or feature implemented
   - Main modification content
   - Related Issue number (if any)
5. Click the "Create Pull Request" button to submit

## 7. Testing Requirements

- All new features must add corresponding unit tests
- After fixing a bug, add test cases to prevent regression
- Ensure all existing tests pass before submitting code
- Use JUnit 5 to write unit tests

## 8. Documentation Contributions

- Documentation is written in Markdown format
- Maintain consistency between Chinese and English documentation
- Documentation should be clear, accurate, and easy to understand
- Add necessary documentation explanations for new features or changes

## 9. Code of Conduct
